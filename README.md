# vim-setup-local
Just my local vim setup script
This is  my first github upload. Rather than writing "Hello World!", I
thought that I would upload my vim setup scripts. I prefer using vim and
use some plugins to make my work easier. This is my attempt at writing a
script that will help me setup vim faster.

Following are the plugins I use. As I start using more, I will add more.  
```
        1. Pathogen - https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen  
        2. YCM - https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe  
        3. Ultisnips - https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips  
        4. vim-snippet - https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets.git
```

####Setup:
```
        1. git clone https://github.com/lufythepirateking/vim-setup-local ~/.vim
        2. ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
